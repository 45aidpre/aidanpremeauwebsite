      <h2 class="fallout-logo">Personal Website</h2>
      <p>I designed this website to simply showcase my ability to use html or css. I attempted to make it my own with colorful themes and a font I thought was creative.</p>
      <h2 class="fallout-logo">Menu Randomizer</h2>
      <p>This was one of my first programming projects which I started on my own and through my education at Florida Gulf Coast University I was able to improve upon my concept. While working in the cooking industry I thought of the idea to practice my skills with c++ by designing a program capable of taking a list or lists of items and randomly generating a menu. Thus far I have succeeded but one day I would like to perhaps add some more front-end capabilities like a website that could produce different styles of menus and allowing the user to print their personalized menu.</p>

      <h2 class="fallout-logo">Natural Computing Algorithms</h2>
      <p>Intro to Natural Computing was a course I took at Florida Gulf Coast University concerning how nature influences some algorithms used in coding and animation. Throughout this course I learned many different methods including but not limited to Boids algorithm, Lindenmayer Systems and Cellular automation. Many of these concern the imitation of natural occurences through simulations. The Boid is simply a particle that follows a particular set of predefined parameters dictating its movement and how it interacts with other particles and space. Most notibly, particle systems like this one are used to simulate flocks of birds in animations like in movies.</p>
      <h2 class="fallout-logo">SQL Database</h2>
      <p>During my Intro to Data Science course, I was introduced to the concept and design of databases using SQL. We then chose groups to work together and build a database containing our chosen collection of information. For our project we chose to store the values of different cryptocurrency in something of a blockchain to store customer transactions. I used inspiration from applications like Coinbase to help desgin the layout of the project.</p>

      <h2 class="fallout-logo">Pharmaceutical SRS Document</h2>
      <p>I created a Software Specifications Document for a fictional Pharmaceutical Software for a course I took titled "Requirements Engeneering & Analysis". This document detailed the creation of the software including specifications for what kind of system and tools would be used for its inception. The majority of the document focuses on the requirements for the software both functional and non-functional.</p>
      <h2 class="fallout-logo">ChatGPT Web Scraper</h2>
      <p>Software Testing was one of my senior courses that I took at Florida Gulf Coast University and helped me produce this project. I built this Web Scraper with two others in a group project where the goal was to test OpenAi's ChatGPT with different prompts to see what responses it would or could provide. With some manner of difficulty we were able to do so, especially with its security for bot detection being so well developed.</p>
      <h2 class="fallout-logo">Calculator Clock</h2>
      <p>A small project written in Python designed to calculate the current time needed to reach a certain moment in time yet to happen or how long since a certain past time period.</p>
